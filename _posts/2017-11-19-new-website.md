Welcome to the new home of the PersWiFiManager docs page. I used a full jekyll template rather than just a gh-pages template, so I have a lot more control over how things are laid out. Hopefully it will be easier to update as well.

Version 3 of the library should be ready soon. This will add an optional non-blocking autoconnect, and handlers for successful or unsuccessful connection.
